# Does perfect software exist?

Take a look at the following chess pussle.

Any mediumly skilled chess player can take a look at the above chess pussle,
and say with 100% confidence who will win, assuming two skilled players are
playing each other. This is because chess is a system of _"perfect information"_.
What this means, is that all variables are known, and there is no _"chance"_ in the
game. In fact, mathematicians have proven that there exists a _"perfect solution"_
to chess, implying you can be 100% certain who will win, depending upon who starts,
as long as some _"recipe"_ is being followed. Chess has in such a regards a
scientific _"perfect solution"_, which guarantees you to win, if you know this solution.
The problem is that the number of permutations before the 1st move is being made,
are so staggeringly large, that no human being, or super computers for that
matter, are capable of calculating all permutations today. However, some time
in the future, chess will be no more interesting than Tic-Tac-Toe is today,
because this perfect solution will be known, and it will be impossible to win
against an opponent who knows this solution, depending upon which color you
play with.

System Development has similar traits. Do you think the following code can even
in theory contain a security hole, assuming your C# compiler, operating system,
and framework does not contain any holes?

```csharp
using System;

class MainClass
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

The answer is of course **no**! It's not possible, not even in theory, that the
above code contains any security holes or bugs. This is because any mediumly
skilled system developer can take a quick look at the code, run it through his
compiler, and scientifically prove that it does not have bugs.

Lizzie is (almost) equally simple in nature as the above code. For a mediumly
skilled C# system developer, it is easy to put the entirety of Lizzie, and all
of its possible permutations, into his or her consciousness at the same time,
and prove that all of its possible permutations are 100% perfectly bug free, and
does not contain security holes, and are according to its specifications. This
is because it's equally simple in nature for a C# system developer, as the above
chess pussle is to a chess player.

I have not yet done this exercize for the record. However, one of these days I
will, and as I do that process, which would probably only require a handful of
days, creating an additional 50-100 unit tests - I would be able to with absolute
certainty, scientifically claim, that Lizzie is 100% perfectly free from bugs,
and 100% perfectly secure, assuming there are no bugs in my compiler, operating
system, or the underlaying framework or CLR.

When I do this, I will clearly mark it as such, and it will be scientifically
impossible to find bugs in it. The reasons for this is quite simple in fact.
All bugs are dependent upon code to exist. If you eliminate the code, there
can be no bugs, and Lizzie contains almost no code - Just like the above chess
pussle contains almost no pieces. So even though Lizzie is _"immature"_ in its
age, it is still probably highly mature in its mind, simply because it has almost
no moving parts.

**No code, no bugs, no problems!**
