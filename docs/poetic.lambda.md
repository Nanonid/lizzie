# poetic.lambda

This project allows you to declare lists and dictionaries of Action
and Func delegates, that you can either execute sequentially, in parallel
(threads), or chained (output from one is given as input to the next).

The project also helps you with synchronising access to shared instances
when doing multi threaded programming.
