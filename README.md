# Simplified Syntactic C# Sugar

You don't need music in your life, sugar in your tea, or poetry in your code.
However, all of these things slightly improve the quality of your life. Poetry
is a collection of small libraries, that somehow makes your code more poetic,
more dynamic, and poetic in the way you express your intentions. Poetry makes
your CLR code dance!

## poetic.lambda

This library allows you to create lists and dictionaries of lambda objects
(delegates), for then to later decide if you want to execute your lambda
objects sequentially, chained or in parallel.

## Installation

Poetry is way far from stable, and currently duper duper ALPHA, ALPHA code!
_DON'T USE IT_ except for research and teaching purposes! If you still want
to check it out, clone the repository.

## License

Poetry is licensed under the terms of the MIT license. See the enclosed LICENSE
file for details.
