# Simplified Syntactic C# Sugar

You don't need music in your life, sugar in your tea, or poetry in your code.
However, all of these things slightly improve the quality of your life. Poetry
is a collection of small libraries, that somehow makes your code more poetic,
more dynamic, and poetic in the way you express your intentions.

## poetic.lambda

This library contains things related to execution of delegates, either
sequentially, or on separate threads.
