# Simplified Syntactic C# Sugar

You don't need music in your life, sugar in your tea, or poetry in your code.
However, all of these things have in common that they slightly improve the
quality of your life. Poetry is a collection of tiny libraries, that somehow
makes your code more poetic in natur, and allows you to simplify your syntax.
In a way it is simply a bunch of design patterns, often needed to deal with
common problems. Poetry makes your C# code more poetic, more easily understood,
more easily changed and modified, and smaller.
