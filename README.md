# Simplified Syntactic C# Sugar

You don't need music in your life, sugar in your tea, or poetry in your code.
However, all of these things slightly improve the quality of your life. Poetry
is a collection of small libraries, that somehow makes your code more poetic,
more dynamic, and poetic in the way you express your intentions.

## poetic.lambda

This library allows you to create chains and dictionaries of lambda objects,
for then to later decide if you want to execute your lambda objects sequentially,
chained or in parallel.
